I am interested in the relational database and big data. Also, I like to program using Python.<br>
Attended web technology bootcamp in [wecode](https://wecode.co.kr) here.<br>
Learned various backend technologies (Python, Django, Flask) and docker and AWS cloud application like S3, Lambda and CloudFront.<br>
This is a project what I did for 2 weeks after classes(https://github.com/wecode-bootcamp-korea/WelonMusk_backend).
